      <h2>Track Ride Construction Set Logic</h2>
      <p class="general">
         Logic used to assemble, compile, assist, persist and reload rides.

      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p class="general">
         Provided all the logic to build the tracks, supports, geometry generation, alignment and tweaking.
         Rides are collections of Track Assembly objects and RidePart objects which have have graphic objects.
         The ride parts hold the implementation cars, physics and operational members.
         The track parts make up the path spline, Track Assembly which has a collecton track rail, tie and support parts
         Each ride part also has a collection of graphic objects that represent the 3D visual acspect.
      </p>
      <p>
         The track components consist of rails, ties, track structure and supports.
         The track components make up a track scection. A section can be of any length and many shapes. Each section
         has a profile that details the track rail thickness, rail count, cross ties if used and the structure.
         Each section can have a different profile than the previous section meaning the track style may change
         for more complex coasters. Each profile defines how the structure and rails are built. The TRCS loades these
         profiles and uses the data from the UI or loaded track to generate these sections. Track sections have a
         serialize method allowing the sections and entire track to be saved and reloaded. The path spline is also
         generated to provide the car animation with a path to follow. Onboard POV cams will also use the splines
         for camera flight. The Path Spline is composed of a z path to follow along with tilt axis for banking.
         Details on the tracks will be further explained in the Core Object section for each object.
      </p>
      <p>
         Besides building track and setting up cars for the coasters, the TRCE will also have to move supports and 
         change support structures in the event of collisions that require the support to move. The user may have the
         ability to sdjust the support to fit a more meaningful arranement or attempt to desing a new one based on track.
