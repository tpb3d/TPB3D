      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p class="general">
         The World is the total encapsulation of the Park and all of it's object contents, the surrounding scene and sky dome.<br />
         Upon game load and startup the current selected scenic surround is created and loaded with the matching tecture.<br />
         The base (background) color of the Open GL view is set to the appropriate color for the season, weather and time of day.<br />
         A Clouds object is created that renders the effective cloud cover, density and color tones.<br />
         The main Park object is created and initialized with the default park settings or parameters from a saved park.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>The Surround and Land for Development</h3>
      <p class="general">
      The Surround object is a ring of meshes that encircles the park forming terrain around the park and a distant rim scene in the background.
      The outer rim is a ribbon mesh that includes a scene texture that shows distant cities, fields, mountains and forests.
      The purpose of the rim is to give an appearance that your park is in a larger world and forms a transistion with the sky.
      We don't want the inhabitants of the world to realize that the world is actually a flat plane on a computer screen.
      The surrounding terrain is a mesh that is generated between the land available for development and the outer rim.
      You may be allowed to build more than rectangular parks in the future. The surround will be build form meshes that
      close in the space beteen left at the edges of the developable land. The land available for development includes 
      any land you own, available for purchase or lease and in some cases local access roads and transportaion terminals.
      </p>
      
      <h3>World Object</h3>
      <p class="general">
      The World object is a collection object that all objects are managed in.
      Manager classes will interact with the world object to interact with the all child objects contained within the world.
      Park piping will involve one or more world collections or within one world. It should be possible to have two parks running
      on one system so that life goes on in one park while you visit another. This will make it possible to have people working in
      different parks in network to server games. For this to work the game will have to be threaded to allow the parks to
      operate independantly but within the same time of day and calender year.
