      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p class="general">
      Open GL provides a lot of flexibility in lighting.
      In the real world lighting is the result photo emissions from any number of sources including lamps and the sun.
      Light also emits from self illuminating objects like digital clocks, tvs, control panels and signs.
      Other light sources are the result of reflected from walls, windows are any object that is lighter in color that
      is itself illuminated by a light source. In the game we will only consider this radiant form of light from
      large objects light walls but only after the game is usable.
      Refraction is another form of light that occurs in transparent objects like glass and water but this too should wait.

      <dt>Objects in Open GL can be lit or possess levele of brightness by several methods.</dt>
      <dd>Intesity of image in a texture.</dd>
      <dd>Color intensity specified in the materials property.</dd>
      <dd>One of the GLLights provided by the Open GL API.</dd>
      <dd>Global Ambiant, Specular and Radiant properies in context when the object is fed to Open GL.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>This subject will expand greatly as lighting in important for high quality rendering.</p>
