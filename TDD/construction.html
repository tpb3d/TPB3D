      <p></p>
      <dl class="topic">
         <dd>
         Surface - multi-textured surface the user can select from grass, sand, gravel, rock or mud.
         In addition to the natural list, faces may also be brick, wood, stone and tile.
         Surface modeling may involve several texturing techniques depending on user changes.
         The user may alter the height, surface texture, color, angle of surface.
         The Game Document more information on Terrain Surface.
         </dd>
         <dd>
         Underground - The user will have options to build underground and into elevated land, hills and mountains.
         Sub-Terranian or tunneling techniques are explained in the Game Docs chapter 1.2.2.1.2.
         Consider that tunneling is a tube structure requiring walling in to form closure.
         Lighting is factored in as ambiant and sourced, dark rides need low ambiant for FX.
         </dd>
         <dd>
         Water - involes users choice of a water table were any area below an elevation set fills with water.
         In some instances the user may build cassons to hold back water.
         Water will contain, texture, surface ripple/waves, color and translucent.
         Waterfalls will be included as available scenery as animated stacked alphas.
         </dd>
         <dd>Saving - like other parts of the Game, the terrain can be save via serialization.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <h4 class="subnote">Paths</h4>
      <dl class="topic">
         <dd>Walkways - Tile with respect to surface tile and Freestyle lay down unrestrained wandering paths.
         Surfaces may be concrete, asphalt, tile. stone, wood planks, metal, brick, dirt.
         A walkway riseing about the mean surface will form an elevated walkway with supports and safety rails.
         Moving belts may also be used as a people mover. Animated texture of a moving belt.
         Steep walks become stairs, moving walkways become escalators.
         Walkways may tunnel, curve, cross other walks and paths.
         </dd>

      <h4 class="subnote">Queues</h4>
      <dl class="topic">
         <dd>Queues can built like sidewalks or as a special structure.
         Will need to generate crowd floaw paths and movement spline.
         Several templates need to be made to feed the path too with location of handrails/ropes.
         Like walkways, queues will have a surface tecture.
         </dd>
         <dt>Park Piping is interjected here in the GDD.</dt>
         <dd>
         Enhancements - The user may add path objects to the paths.
         Lamps, Benches, Tables, Wastecans, Drinking fountains, maps and signs.
         These can be postitiond anywhere on the path and standard collision ruled apply.

         Flat - FRCS, assembly, storage, import, compile and place.

         Track - TRCS, assembly, supports, guardrails, stations.
         </dd>
         <dd>
         Other Track Rides - OTRCS, same ad TRCS but with differne track modes many not involving rails.
