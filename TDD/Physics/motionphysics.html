      <h2>Motion Physics</h2>
      <p class="general">
         Real world motion requires physics dealing with both potential and kinetic energy.

      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p class="topic">
         When an object is in motion we have to add time into the equations to create time slice intervals.
         In most cases the update methods dealing with objects depending on physics will not occur on precise intervals.
         We have to consider where in a time interval an object has traveled and calculate where it is in the current time
         interval. Weight loads will also vary as time moves on for many objects.
         Most objects that move will have to consider pre calculated physics or dynamic physics.
         This module deals with the dynamic forces affecting the objects in motion.

      and weight at one end.</p>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <dl>
      <dt>Physics covered in game</dt>
      <dd>Single Pentulum - single arm, oscillations may be single axis or orbital</dd>
      <dd>Compound Pendula - two or more linkages exist in the arm resulting in articulated swing.</dd>
      <dd>Potential and Kinetic energies - Objects exposed to varying grades or in pendulous motion.</dd>
      <dd>Wave - Flags, tents water or objects with flexibility and exposed to a force of wind or other energy source.</dd>
      <dd>Gravity - consider any object above grade or unsupport has potential energy and a terminal velocity.</dd>
      <dd>Rotation - mostly resistance and inertia.</dd>
      <dd>Ballistics - any object propelled will be consided ballistics even constrained objects like coasters and cars on other rides.
      Should one derail or dismount it becomes a missle and is then consider unconstrained.
      Some rides also use bungie coards and or cables allowing for ballistic flight.</dd>
      <dd>Partical - Involving many free-floating objects. Gravity and drag coefficients may apply.</dd>
