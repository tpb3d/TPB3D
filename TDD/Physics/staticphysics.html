      <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      <p class="general">
         The intent of this section is to apply logic and reason to placement to objects that are stationary.
         Check whether the object can possibly fit in a location or is it properly supported.
         Should we allow a merry-go-round to balance on a pole or a coaster go under water with no tunnel.
         Might want to consider this the department of standards and permitted construction.
         Limits on heights of rides depending on terrain and contruction components.
         Users may turn this off if they want to build fantasy parks.
