      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p class="general">
      Buildings will be made up of pre-assembled models or constucted.
      Modeled buildings will only have some flexibility to be altered.
      Assembled buildings will be able to be altered in may ways to accomidate the area where the
      building is being placed within reason. This does not dictate how buildings are to be built
      but provides tools to assemble them for the user and Building Generator. The Builder object
      in this code is the assistant that assembles the building from data fed in. The UI and Building
      Generator must supply the data that instructs what to assemble. Saved buildings will just load
      in and be assembled from the same data use to create it.
