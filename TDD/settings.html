      <h4>Interface</h4>
      <p>Player modifications to the operation of mice, joysticks, keyboard and video devices.</p>
      <p class="note">
         All events from input deviced are mapped through event delegates. Delegates can be created and destroyed on the fly.
         To change the behavior of an input device simply create the new action delegate that matches the users action then
         swap the current delegate with the new delegate and destroy the old delegate. This behavoir removes the switch logic
         logic that every click or event has to run through greatly simplifing logic in the event handlers.

      <h4>Developer notes</h4>
      <p class="note">
      Data settings here are persisted through normal serialization methods.<br />
      UI interactions are passed through events and data packets to allow real time changes.<br />
      Network operations will be able to tap into the events, serialization and data packets.<br />
      At this time data packets are structure based and may change.
